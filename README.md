This repository holds the scripts used to assess how stream discharge in the upper midwest of the USA responds to changes in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Stream discharge data were accessed from the US Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) using the R package dataRetrieval. The ENSO metric used was the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI).
